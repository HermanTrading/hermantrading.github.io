<p>Hi, I’m Herman — a passionate day trader and a programmer by heart. I love coding just as much as I love the markets. With an analytical mindset and a strong background in software development, I approach trading with structure, logic, and precision. I specialize in futures trading and enjoy building and testing mechanical models that allow for objective and consistent decisions.</p>
